I am sharing my learning experience of Web Development, coding, design, and debugging process. As we know that the first step is always tough and difficult but we should be able to tackle those difficulties.I had faced many difficulties in web development. Web Development is one of the interesting course .This Course provides many opportunity for the students who are willing to be web developer.I had faced many difficulties in this web development course. At first, i don't know what to do , how to do ,how to code, how to make like that.I have no idea at that time but after time passes i go through those slides and read those slides and also i have taken help from  internet. <br><br><h3>About Coding</h3><br>I haven't done coding before but in my view coding is more fun as well as sometimes it's very boring . while we are doing coding , we don't know how the time goes so fast.<br><br><h3> Design</h3><br>Design is the most important part for doing any Project. Without design nothing looks more attractive and design gives the aesthetic looks which attract all the user or client.<br><br><h3>Debugging</h3><br>Debugging is the process of identifying error in any software or hardware. In this HTML and CSS we find the error from the developer tool.<br><br><h3>Module Experience</h3><br>Throughout this 1st term, I have enjoyed the web Development Module. It has been good to develop my knowledge and understanding in each of the different areas within Web Development.<p>The module as a whole has enabled me to look further into specific areas which are of interest to me.The motivation and encouragement that are provided by teacher was invaluable.I feel i have learnt a lot from them as students, sharing ideas ang thoughts about many different issues. In this term i have faced ups and down in this course. <p>Overall, I have enjoyed the module. This module gives me more lesson and now I am able to do something.</p><br><br><h3>Decision Making</h3><br>Quite simply, We don't. we're all quite capable of making perfectly good decisions on our own with no outside help. We need a validator to make a clean valid website code, it help ensure that our output is as good as it should be. While some people naturally make good decusions, other struggle and need the support of a model or framework, in tha same way tha some people naturally make balanced web design and others prefer the help from other source. <br><br>I have use the developer tool for changing the color and for font i simply use general fonts . I haven't use the font from the google in this assignment. Also, i use link tag to link the other pages.<br><br><h3>Images of each pages</h3><br><br>
